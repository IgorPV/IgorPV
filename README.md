# Welcome! I'm Igor

Hi! My name is **Igor Pereira Vieira**.
I was born in SÃ£o Paulo :brazil:, and since i was a little boy i had a knack for the tech world, and specially the STEM side of life. 
I love to learn new technologies and i'm always fascinated by how things work. 
I attended Unicamp (State University of Campinas), where i graduated as a Civil Engineer (and worked in that field for a bit over a year). In 2020 i decided to change my life and embrace my tech side for good, so here i am!
I hope to share knowledge with as many people as possible, as well as developing software that could improve people's lifes.
